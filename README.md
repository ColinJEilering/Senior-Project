I sent a secret.env file to you on discord. Put it in the same directory as the manage.py file.

To run this:

IN TERMINAL: 
Navigate to where your manage.py file is, 
type:

python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver

Then go to your localhost or http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser
